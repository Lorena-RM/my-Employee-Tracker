The NPM packages are on the package.json for you to simply run this command in your terminal:

```
npm i
```
once I have done that in order to run the application with Data already in the application i must first create my database and seed it with the sql files inside the DB folder

Below is a short GIF to help you understand exact steps for installation for a smooth application run:
