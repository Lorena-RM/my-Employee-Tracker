The NPM packages are on the package.json for you to simply run this command in your terminal:

```
npm i
```
once I have done that in order to run the application with Data already in the application i must first create my database and seed it with the sql files inside the DB folder

Below is a short GIF to help you understand exact steps for installation for a smooth application run:

![gif example](./assets/images/installation.gif)

once sql files have been sourced in MYSQL run the following command in your terminal

```
npm start
```

[DB beaver](https://dbeaver.io/) was an excellent visual resource for me to use in order to be able to view my data base and be able to recognize and connect how my tables work together

Below is an example of my database schema in more of a visual form
